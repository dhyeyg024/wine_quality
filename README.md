# wine_quality
Created the ML model for predicting the quality of wine based on 11 features. I got this dataset from Kaggle and implemented EDA, data pre-processing, data wrangling, cleaning, etc. and feed the data into ML model.
I tried 3 different models but Random Forest Classifier performed the best.
